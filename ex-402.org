* Exercise 402

#+begin_quote
Reread exercise 354. Explain the reasoning behind our hint to think of the given expression
as an atomic value at first.
#+end_quote

The hint suggests that because by then we had =subst= available to us. Since =subst= dealt
with the details of the expression's actual structure, and since its return value was
a new expression, we could structure our solution as a series of =subst= applications,
driven by the structure of =da=.
