* Exercise 438

#+begin_quote
In your words: how does =greatest-divisor-<== work? Use the design recipe to find the
right words. Why does the locally defined =greatest-divisor-<== recur on
=(min n m)=
#+end_quote

The function works its way backward from =(min n m)=, checking the number at any given
recursive step evenly divides both =n= and =m=. The first number which does is the greatest
common divisor. The starting point is =(min n m)= because, given two numbers, it is
impossible for them to have a =gcd= that's greater than the smaller of the two; after all,
dividing a number by a larger number necessarily results in a ratio.
