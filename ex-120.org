* Exercise 120

Discriminate the legal from the illegal sentences:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(x)
(+ 1 (not x))
(+ 1 2 3)
#+END_SRC


** Sentence 1
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(x)
#+END_SRC

This is illegal. It's an incomplete variable application.

** Sentence 2
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(+ 1 (not x))
#+END_SRC

This is a legal =expr=.

- =(not x)= Is a legal primitive application (=(primitive expr expr ...)=)
- =(+ 1 (not x))= Is a legal primitive application itself

** Sentence 3
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(+ 1 2 3)
#+END_SRC

This is a legal =expr=, particularly a single primitive application.
