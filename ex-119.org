* Exercise 119

Consider the following sentences:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f "x") x)
(define (f x y z) (x))
#+END_SRC

Explain why these are syntactically illegal.

** Sentence 1
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f "x") x)
#+END_SRC

A =def= has the form =(define (variable variable variable ...) expr)=. While the first part up until
=f= conforms to the rule, ="x"= is not a =variable=, but a =value=, making the sentence
illegal.

** Sentence 2
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f x y z) (x))
#+END_SRC

In this case =expr= can either be a primitive or a variable application. It is not the
former, since =x= is not a primitive. But it also doesn't conform to the latter, since
a variable application has the form =(variable expr expr ...)=, meaning, it has at least one
=expr= after the variable. Therefore, the sentence is illegal.
