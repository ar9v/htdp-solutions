What is unusual about the definition of this program with respect to the design recipe?

*NOTE:* One unusual aspect is that =parse= uses =length= on the list argument. Real parsers
avoid =length= because it slows the functions down.

** Answer
The function (at least =parse-sl=) does not follow the template we'd
come up by following /S-expr/'s data definition: it relies on =length=, its =cond= clauses
check to make sure that the length is a given number, and generally speaking, it "peeks"
into the provided expression to determine what to do.
