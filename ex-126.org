* Exercise 126

Identify the =value=s among the following expressions, assuming the definitions area
contains these structure type definitions

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define-struct point [x y z])
(define-struct none [])
#+END_SRC


1. =(make-point 1 2 3)=
   This is a =make-point= structure value, itself made up of three values, =1=, =2=, and =3=
2. =(make-point (make-point 1 2 3) 4 5)=.
   This is a =make-point= structure value, itself made up of three values: another
   =make-point= value with values =1=, =2=, and =3=, =4=, and =5=.
3. =(make-point (+ 1 2) 3 4)=
   This is a =make-point= structure value, made up of values =3=, =3=, and =4=.
4. =(make-none)=
   This is a structure value, =make-none=.
5. =(make-point (point-x (make-point 1 2 3)) 4 5)=
   This is a =make-point= structure value, made up of values =1=, =4=, and =5=. To get the
   first value, we call =point-x= on another =make-point= structure value, itself conformed
   of values =1=, =2=, and =3=.

All of these expressions are values. Remember that the beta rule establishes that a
program tries to reduce an expression to a value. All of these are legal, and can be
dropped into the interactions area and run, which shows they produce values.
