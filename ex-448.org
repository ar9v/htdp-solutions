* Exercise 448

#+begin_quote
The =find-root= algorithm terminates for all (continuous) =f=, =left=, and =right=
for which the assumption holds. Why? Formulate a termination argument.
#+end_quote

Say =f= is continuous and the assumption for =left= and =right= holds. Then that means
=f= /has/ a root, and it /has/ to be between =left= and =right=. Each iteration, the interval
is cut by half; after =~log_2(n)= steps (for ε = 1), we'll have divided the interval's size
to a point where =right - left= is smaller than our error. For other values of ε, the
key thing to keep in mind is that division will always yield a smaller interval size.
Since the algorithm keeps the ends of the interval on opposite sides of the axis,
we're guaranteed to not "overshoot", therefore missing the root and looping.
