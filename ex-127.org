* Exercise 127

Suppose the program contains

#+begin_src racket
(define-struct ball [x y speed-x speed-y])
#+end_src

Predict the results of evaluating the following expressions:

1. =(number? (make-ball 1 2 3 4))=
   Returns =#false=
2. =(ball-speed-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))=
   Returns =3=
3. =(ball-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))=
   Returns =6=
4. =(ball-x (make-posn 1 2))=
   This errors. =ball-x= only works on values that are =make-ball=.
5. =(ball-speed-y 5)=
   This errors. =ball-speed-y= only works on values that are =make-ball=.
