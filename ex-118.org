* Exercise 118

Take a look at the following sentences:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f x) x)
(define (f x) y)
(define (f x y) 3)
#+END_SRC

Explain why they are syntactically legal definitions

** Sentence 1
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f x) x)
#+END_SRC

A =program= element is either a =def= or an =expr=. A =def= has the form
=(define (variable variable variable ...) expr)=.

- This sentence starts with =(define=
- Then, it has =(= followed by at least two =variable=, =f= and =x=
- Lastly, it has =x=, which is a =variable= (and type of =expr=) and closes with =)=

Therefore, this is a legal definition.

** Sentence 2
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f x) y)
#+END_SRC

This follows the same argument as Sentence 1, only instead of having =x= as an =expr=, we
have =y=. This is syntactically valid. There is no syntactic requirement for a definition
to use its parameter in =expr=.

** Sentence 3
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define (f x y) 3)
#+END_SRC

This follows the same argument as Sentence 1, only instead of having =x= as an =expr=, we
have =3=.
